      The staff of a Chicago medical organization are suing because it <a href="

      10% of the workers in Britain have been captured by

    <p>
      Thousands of Americans &mdash; perhaps hundreds of thousands
      &mdash; have been killed because judges sealed evidence of
      deadly defects in products and kept the defects secret for years
      as more people died.  The dangerous flaws of OxyContin, which
      spread opioid addiction, were
      <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-courts-secrecy-judges/">concealed
	for 12 years</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trade secrecy is <em>always</em> bad for the public.
      Occasionally it is deadly, but usually merely harmful.  We
      should change the law so that no significant problem can be
      concealed in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Busineses should not be allowed to enforce an NDA to conceal
      mistreatment of workers, customers, or the public.

    <p>
      Agreeing to nondisclosure of generally useful technical
      information, such as software, is betrayal of society as a
      whole.  I refuse on principle to do this.

      This is the natural conclusion of the twisted premises of those
      who treat fetuses as sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the problem may be broader than that.  Suppose she had been
      shot while carrying a three-year-old child in her arms?  Suppose
      someone else had shot at her and killed the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't think people should be prosecuted for the effects of
      being shot at.

      Facebook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa">treats
	the video moderators like shit</a>.  And that's in addition to
	the depression they feel from watching the videos.
    </p>
    <p>
      The article gives no evidence that Utley's death was caused by
      his job, but the way the managers treated it is despicable even
      if they did not cause it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, these workers are subcontracted, so that Facebook can
      deny responsibility for how they are treated.  But Facebook is
      in fact responsible: it demands contractors offer a low price,
      which they achieve by treating the workers like shit.  We need
      laws to hold companies like Facebook responsible for the
      treatment of indirect workers, and give them employee rights
      such as sick leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be a felony for employees of a company to ask a worker
      to sign a nondisclosure agreement covering any aspect of the
      working conditions, benefits, or pay.

      <p>Senate Democrats have introduced a data privacy bill which begins, though
      just barely, <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/26/expert-says-senate-democrats-sweeping-online-privacy-bill-answers-public-demand">to limit collection of some data</a>.</p>

      <p>But it has obvious loopholes.  It won't require companies to reveal
      the conclusions they have deduced from the personal data they have
      access to &mdash; because they argue that those are not "the client's
      data."  It won't, as far as I can see, limit the targeted ads that are
      the basis for surveillance capitalism.</p>

      <p>And it won't even try to make it possible to buy something over the
      internet anonymously.  <a href="https://taler.net">We have the technology for this</a>.</p>

      <p>The most sensitive personal data about you are where you go during the
      day, what you do there, who you talk with, and what what you and they
      say.  It should be illegal to set up or operate a system <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">which systematically collects any of those data, except when authorized
      by a court order targeted at specific people</a>.</p>

      <p>I propose a law requiring stores to offer the service of bringing an
      item to the store for you to buy later, in exchange for an ordering
      fee paid in advance.</p>

<h3>No national identity cards</h3>
<p>
I'd like to make a list of countries that do not require a national
identity card, and have no plans to adopt one. If you live in or have
confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at
gnu.org.

<p>
Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards
and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK.
Australia's previous government tried to
institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped
the plan.</p>

<p>India has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number
in a grand act of oppression.
</p>

<p>Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional,
but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.
<p>
Iceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they
have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
For example, the national ID number is often required to
rent a video or use a gym.
</p>

<p>
Denmark issues non-photo ID cards with a "person number", and many
services use this card to identify people.
</p>

<p>
Norway will impose a national
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Norwegian_citizens_now_required_by_law_to_give_their_fingerprint_to_the_police.html">biometric
ID card</a>.

<h3>The Lifelong Activist</h3>
<p>
People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to
progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
years without burning out.  The best way I can answer is by
recommending a book, <a href="http://lifelongactivist.com">
The Lifelong Activist</a> by Hillary Rettig.

<p>I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
<em>being</em> marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
business, and politics is something much more
important than mere business.  However, this doesn't diminish
the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
techniques from marketing and sales.</p>
